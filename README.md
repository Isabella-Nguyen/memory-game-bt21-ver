# Memory Game BT21 ver.
This is a Grade 11 computer science (ICS3U) summative game written in Python. It's a fun take on the classic memory game! This game includes fun characters and a few special features to spice up the classics. Play this with your kids or friends and see who can succeed with the least moves. Alternatively, you can try and set a personal record!

### Instructions
Find all 7 pairs without picking the "bomb" card.
Each turn, you can pick 2 cards. If the two cards are the same, they will stay flipped over. If they are different, the cards will be flipped over again. You will need to keep picking pairs until you find all 7 pairs.
But you must be careful of the bomb! Once the bomb is clicked, all cards will be flipped over and you will have to restart.

### Some features:
- **"Bomb" card:** resets (flip over) all cards in the game.
- **Settings:** opens a "pop-up" that includes restart, quit, help and go back options.
- **Moves:** this game tracks the amount of moves the player uses.
- **Pygame:** I learned how to use pygame and work with graphical interfaces through this project.

### Opening the game
There is one python file in the repository; this is the code for the game that can be run to play the game. 
All the other files are images that should be in the same folder as the python file.

*Note to self: next time put all the images in a folder so it looks cleaner!!*

### Future - Everything can always be improved, you just have to search for it!
This game was made a little while ago, so now that I look back there are many upgrades that can be made to make this game even more enjoyable.

Some ideas:
- Have a high score feature that saves the high score even when the user quits the game.
- Create different modes of difficulty, harder modes having more cards.
- Or maybe have a mode with limited moves.
